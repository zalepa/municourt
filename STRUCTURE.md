# Page Structure

Each page starts with a header:

```
MUNICIPAL COURT STATISTICS
<MONTH YEAR> - <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
<COUNTY>
<MUNICIPALITY/CITY>
```

Then each page includes a table that has ten (10) columns:

1. Empty
1. Indictables
1. D.P. & P.D.P.
1. Other Criminal
1. Criminal Total
1. D.W.I. 
1. Traffic (moving)
1. Parking 
1. Traffic Total
1. Grand Total

The table has eight rows:

1. Filings
2. Resolutions
3. Clearance
4. Clearance Percent
5. Backlog
6. Backlog/100 Mthly Filings
7. Backlog Percent
8. Active Pending

However, these rows also have "sub"-rows where the actual data is stored. So
it looks more like this:

1. Filings
- <MONTH YEAR-1> - <MONTH-1 YEAR>
- <MONTH YEAR> - <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
- % Change
2. Resolutions
- <MONTH YEAR-1> - <MONTH-1 YEAR>
- <MONTH YEAR> - <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
- % Change
3. Clearance
- <MONTH YEAR-1> - <MONTH-1 YEAR>
- <MONTH YEAR> - <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
4. Clearance Percent
- <MONTH YEAR-1> - <MONTH-1 YEAR>
- <MONTH YEAR> - <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
5. Backlog
- <MONTH-1 YEAR>
- <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
- % Change
6. Backlog/100 Mthly Filings
- <MONTH-1 YEAR>
- <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
- % Change
7. Backlog Percent
- <MONTH-1 YEAR>
- <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
8. Active Pending
- <MONTH-1 YEAR>
- <MONTH-1 YEAR+1>
- % Change

All in there are 16 rows then and 8 columns. Each intersection has a value no 
matter what ("- -" is used for no value).

The rest of the data can be ignored:

- "The method of calculating backlog changed in July 2004. Pre-July 2004 backlog data was adjusted to provide estimates based on the new calculation"
- "The Supreme Court’s order dismissed approximately 273,000 cases on December 12, 2022. The traffic cases were temporarily reactivated and then immediately dismissed."
